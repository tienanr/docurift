# Persistence Layer Design

## Data Storage

The Analyzer implements a simple file-based persistence mechanism:

- **Storage Location**: `analyzer.json` in the local directory
- **Storage Format**: JSON format matching the API response structure
- **Storage Frequency**: Every 10 seconds during runtime

## Data Loading

On startup, the Analyzer performs the following initialization:

1. Checks for the existence of `analyzer.json` in the local directory
2. If found, loads the data into its internal store
3. Begins serving traffic with the restored state

This persistence mechanism ensures data continuity between Analyzer restarts.
